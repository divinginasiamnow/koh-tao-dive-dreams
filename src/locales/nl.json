      "fullDescription": "Take a simple 4 days of your time and learn how to dive, how to get confidence and control underwater and receive a certification valid for the rest of your life, all around the globe.\n\nThe \"Open Water Course\", considered as the 1st level of PADI, is perfectly built for whoever wants to know what all the basics of scuba diving are.\n\nStep by step, you'll get to know and understand why so many of us fell in love with it and made it a career. Some theory, some preparation in the pool, just to get used to it, and a lot of time in open sea, that's what it is.\n\nDuring a minimum of 4 dives, your instructor will show you, teach you and tell you all about diving. By the time he'll be signing your certification, you'll be ready to join the big world of divers, crazy people, same as we are, travelling, working and simply waking up in the morning just to jump back in and get back to this unbelievable aquatic life.\n\nAs Open Water diver, your depth limit will be 18 meters, valid everywhere around the world and good for the rest of your life.\n\nMaterial, all included in the course, is available in multiple languages. Personal advice: if English is not your 1st language but you are still comfortable with it, get everything done in English. If you do fall in love with it…on your future dives, English will always be the one you'll find on any diving destination.\n\nThe course is not only based on theory or skills, some of your dives will be simply swimming around, looking at things and breathing underwater. Probably the best feeling…like being in space, but underwater!",

      "fullDescription": "Second level, done with the Open Water and time to get more into details, into practical stuff, into different techniques…well then it's time for the Advanced course.\n\nWithin 2 days, or more, complete 5 adventure dives and get certified. The main reason why people get to do the \"Advanced\" is to be allowed to dive up to 30 meters deep, which is a very good reason, but that's not it, the course offers also plenty of other options and advantages.\n\nThe Advanced course includes 16 different options of dives from which you will have to choose five. Considering your location, some of the options can differ from those offered in cold countries and warm countries. One thing for sure, 2 of the 5 dives are mandatory: the Deep and the Navigation dives.\n\nOn the deep dive, your instructor will be taking you to a depth of 30 meters and test you regarding the \"nitrogen narcosis\" effect on your brain. Some people get knocked; some people start acting foolish and others pretend (!!) not to feel anything. This dive will certainly be a good laugh and of course will allow you to reach such depth on any further dives.\n\nDuring the Navigation dive, you'll be learning more about underwater orientation. Using both natural reference and compass, your instructor might ask you to find back the boat for him…hum…let's see if you'll manage! There will be also some distance calculation using both fin kick and time. Same as the deep…it usually ends up in a good laugh!\n\nFor the other 3 dives, you'll have the chance to choose in between all the options. What we usually recommend our students is to take the \"Peak Performance Buoyancy\" dive, which consists in breathing skills, different fin kicks and hovering exercise. Many people also go for the \"Night Dive\", experiencing the aquatic life in dark, using a torch to light on the rabbit fish getting hypnotized and attacked by the giant Barracuda hanging around you! You'll get to choose either the \"Underwater Photography\", the \"Multi-Level and Computer diving\", the \"Fish Identification\" or the Naturalist dive.\n\nAlmost like fun diving, over a minimum of 2 days, you can get your certification and be now ready for any diving location. Being an Open Water Diver brings you the diving world, but being an Advanced diver opens all the possible doors!\n\nIf any of you plan to go diving in the Similan Islands or in Sipadan Islands for example, the \"Advanced\" level will be required for most of the dive sites. Keep this in mind and get it done!",

Someone choking, unconscious, in shock, injured with serious bleeding or simply unresponsive, do you remember what to do in such situations?\n\nNot necessarily related to diving, the EFR course is a prerequisite before enrolling into the Rescue Course. If you did a similar course from a recognized association in the past year, as long as you have proof, you'll be able to start your Rescue Diver level straight away. But if not, an EFR course will be necessary.\n\nAnd you know what? Why not?! Such formation does not only have something to do with diving incidents, but can also be useful in your daily life.\n\nDo you remember or do you know what to do with someone having a heart attack, someone having a stroke or with a severe airway obstruction? What about if you have to do chest compressions, did you know that it's now 30 compressions to 2 rescue breaths for both kids and adults? What about if you find your friend with a very rapid pulse and clammy skin, do you remember what it could be?\n\nThe Emergency First Responder course will cover all that. Some of you will only need to refresh their skills and others will practice it for the 1st time, doesn't matter, as long as you realize how important this knowledge can be.\n\nOne day in the classroom with your instructor, talking, demonstrating, practicing and responding to different scenarios and here you are, certified as an Emergency First Responder.\n\nYour certification will be valid for 2 years before having to simply refresh the notions.\n\nIf you did such a course during the last year and plan to come and do your \"Rescue Course\", please bring proof or your card.",

Giving you such a confidence underwater, the \"rescue course\" will make you a safe diver, no doubt.\n\nConduct over 2 to 3 days, here comes the time to realise how good it can be to know how to handle a diver in panic at the surface, missing, unconscious at 9 meters deep or simply tired at the surface asking for help to get back to the boat or the shore.\n\nPractice, academic presentation including emergency procedures, oxygen use and all the other aspect and example of accident or diving injury, open water session and many scenarios are part on this intense course. Everybody that went through that course said the same; it is probably the most exiting and serious course of all. It will make you a better diver controlling yourself enough to be able to control another diver in need of help.\n\nStrange to think those 2 to 3 days will give you such confidence, but it does! No better way to understand safety, going for the rescue course is adding a big point on your experience.\n\nRemember that in certain places of the world, people will let you dive on your own with your buddy. How do you think it feel to know that you know exactly what to do in case of emergency? I guess it probably feels very good!",

Being a Dive Master means you can start working as a professional, start leading people and basically earning money for doing what you like. Sounds brilliant, doesn't it!\n\nSome of the things you will be able to do as a PADI Dive Master:\n• Work in a dive centre or a live-aboard\n• Assist an Instructor during courses\n• Lead certified divers on their fun dives\n• Conduct a scuba review for certified divers that haven't been diving for a while\n\nTake a bit of time off and join us for a couple of weeks on Koh Tao…couple of weeks which will probably turn up to be couple of months, as most of those who came to do their training never left and went even further in their career!\n\nThe Dive Master training is about 2 to 3 weeks. Unless you decide to do an Internship program, which can stretch your formation up to 6 to 8 weeks. Not only will you have unlimited diving during the time of your course, but you'll also get the chance to get involved in the diving industry.\n\nConsidered as the first \"pro level\", we'll teach you the inside as well as the outside of the diving world. How things work in a dive centre, how to lead dives with certified divers, how to assist an instructor on courses and how to take action in the daily activities of a dive shop.\n\nThe course is split in 2 segments: theory and practice. The theory is based on 8 exams: PADI Dive Master conducted Programs, Supervising Student Divers in training, Supervising Activities for Certified Divers, Physics, Physiology, Equipment, Decompression Theory and the RDP, and Skills and Environment.\n\nFor the practical part, you'll have to assist on courses, on guided dives with certified divers, you'll have to work on an emergency assistance plan, on the map of a dive site and on your underwater skills.\n\nDuring your training you will receive lectures from instructors and Course Directors to help you out with the \"knowledge development\" section. The theory is actually very interesting and it will give you a totally different view of what divers go through and learn during their courses or career.\n\nNot only a course, you'll find out that our DMTs are also quite active and you'll get to share a lot of time with them during our famous DMT BBQ and all those nights out which they have together with the rest of the team from the dive shop.\n\nBasically, it's not just a training, but it's a great opportunity to meet a lot of other people that fell in love with the diving community and it's also loads of fun, 100% guaranteed!",

      "fullDescription": "Ok, now we're really talking serious! Here's a major step into the diving world; becoming an instructor, teaching your students what you've learned, what you've experienced, what to do to be a good diver…and then signing them off, proud of what you've done, proud that you made them brilliant divers!\n\nThis is what diving instructors do every day, sharing their passion and transmitting it to others. They offer their knowledge, sit by the sea the time of a drink, talking about what went right, what could be better, what should their student change and what they did good! With an active status of Instructor, you'll be able to teach all courses from Open Water up to Dive Master.\n\nOur 2 Course Directors, Mark and Darius, both \"Platinum Course Directors\" will take you on a 14-day adventure, during which they will prepare you for the big day, the Instructor Examination. With many years of experience behind them, they probably stopped counting the certifications. Lectures and presentations are just natural for them, normal when you've been teaching IDCs since 1997!\n\nFirst 4 days will be more of a preparation for the course. The Course Director will go through some theory and confined skills with the candidate and figure out what you are good at or what they will have to work on and focus more with you during the following days.\n\nThen the real IDC starts, another 10 days of hard work. Academic presentations, PADI general standards and procedures exams, theory exams, Open Water Presentation for each level (Open Water, Advanced, Rescue and Dive Master), confined presentation, just to name some of the stuff which will need to be done. Everybody agrees on how intense the course is, but everybody also agrees on how well those 2 Course Directors prepare their candidates for the big day. Well, let's just be honest, none of their students ever failed!\n\nThe way you'll get prepared, is the way the Examiner will need to see you on the official last 3 days of evaluation: a professional instructor who deserves to get the best score on each presentation!\n\nIf you think of becoming an Instructor, keep in mind that another good way to prepare yourself for an IDC is to assist on many different courses before starting the training. The best for you is to come a month earlier to be able to assist, for free, different instructors. Also, during this month, you'll be able to join on fun diving, also for free!\n\nYou need to get your own material (diving encyclopaedia, instructor manual, slates, etc.) by simply getting the \"IDC pack\", everything you'll need is in it. This is something that you can sort out once you get here, much better than carrying it all the way to the Island…save your kilos for clothes, because you might end up getting a job and staying here much longer than you thought!\n\nThe big day, the last 3 days during which a PADI examiner will come to the Island and evaluate your skills, your presentation and your ability to teach.\n\nDon't get us wrong, the examiners are not big and scary (!!), but just normal people who want to make sure that, yes, the way you've been prepared is how PADI wants to be represented through people like you in their future diving career.\n\nThe I.E. will go on for 3 days, involving more academic presentation, skills demonstration, open water presentation as well as written exam on the first day. If your Course Director brings you to the IE, it's because they already know that YOU are ready…so no need for any stress!!\n\nThe 3 days will fly and without even realizing it, you'll be already done, sitting in a bar with all the candidates, celebrating your victory, your new status as a PADI diving instructor.\n\nBy the way, the IE party is a \"must\", one of the best monthly events on Koh Tao!!!\n\n**Please note: to begin your IDC you need at least 60 logged dives, but to enter the IE, you will need 100 dives.",
