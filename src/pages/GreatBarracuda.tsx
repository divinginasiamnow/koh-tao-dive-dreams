      detailedDescription="The great barracuda is one of the most impressive predatory fish in Koh Tao's waters, with their sleek silver bodies and intimidating rows of razor-sharp teeth. These powerful hunters can reach speeds of up to 40km/h in short bursts, making them formidable predators. While they look menacing, barracuda are generally not aggressive towards divers unless provoked. They are frequently seen at deeper dive sites like Sail Rock and Chumphon Pinnacle, where they hunt in packs around the granite formations. Their presence indicates a healthy ecosystem with abundant prey species."
