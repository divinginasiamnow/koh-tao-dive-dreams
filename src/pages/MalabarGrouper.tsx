      detailedDescription="The Malabar grouper is one of the largest and most impressive grouper species found at Koh Tao's deeper dive sites. These powerful predators are known for their ability to rapidly extract victims from coral crevices using powerful suction feeding. They are relatively shy and tend to retreat into caves when divers approach, but patient observation often rewards with sightings of these magnificent fish. Their impressive size and predatory nature make them a highlight of deep reef diving."
