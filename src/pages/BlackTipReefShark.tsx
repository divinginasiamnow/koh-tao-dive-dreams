Named for the distinctive black tips on their fins, these sharks are active hunters during the day and can often be seen patrolling the reefs or resting in small caves. They are generally not aggressive towards humans and provide an exciting but safe diving experience. During breeding season, young sharks are particularly abundant, offering amazing photo opportunities for both divers and snorkelers."
